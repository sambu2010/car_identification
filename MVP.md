### Car images classification

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning algorithm for car detection that will be identifying make and model of the car by looking at the image of the car.

To start exploring this goal I built a deep learning network with 5 hidden layers and ran both train and test data through it

For the future work I want to try reduce overfitting by applying different regularization techniques to my model and apply transfer learning after that to reduce training time and improve resutls
