## Project Proposal

The goal of this project will be to build a deep learning algorithm for car detection that will be identifying make and model of the car by looking at the image of the car.


### Data Description

The main dataset used for this project will be the Stanford Car Dataset. It contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 split. Classes are typically at the level of Make, Model, Year, e.g. 2012 Tesla Model S or 2012 BMW M3 coupe.

### Tools used

The analysis will be done using python. numpy and pandas will be used for data manipulation, tensorflow for data modeling, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization


### MVP

The MVP for this project will be a simple baseline model for car identification.
